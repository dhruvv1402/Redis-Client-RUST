# Tokio Async Task 

A demonstration of asynchronous task processing using Tokio, Rust's async runtime. This project showcases various real-world scenarios including network requests simulation, data processing, and error handling in an asynchronous context.

## Features

- Complex async task execution with varying durations
- Simulated network requests
- Error handling for long-running tasks
- Concurrent task processing

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

## Running the Demo

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the demo:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Project Structure

The main functionality is implemented in `src/main.rs`, demonstrating:
- Task spawning and management
- Error handling patterns
- Concurrent execution with different processing times
- Network request simulation
